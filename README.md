# UKKB_Analyzer
A package used to run Machine Learning as well as Statical Analysis on UK_BioBank data


## Association Rule Learning: (undone)
  - Input must be only one hot encoded and outcome variables has to be categorized
  - can't include continuous variables

## Mediation Analysis: (undone)
  - (Not 100% sure) Outcome preferably continuous
  - mediator can be either continuous or categorical (doesn't need to be one hot encoded)
  - independent can be either continuous or categorical (doesn't need to be one hot encoded)

## Mendelian Randomization (undone)
  - Don't remember honestly but I think continuous and categorical non-one-hot-encoded variables are fine

## Multivariate Regression (undone)
  - categorical variables need to be one hot encoded
  - continuous variables are okay
  - outcome variable has to be continuous

## Logistic Regression (Odds Ratios) (undone)
  - categorical variables need to be one hot encoded
  - continuous variables are okay
  - outcome variable has to be binary or categorical

## ANOVA (undone)
  - indep variables have to be categorical (preferably not one hot encoded)
  - outcome variable has to be continuous

## Association Analysis (G-Test) (undone)
  - indep variables have to be categorical (preferably not one hot encoded)
  - outcome variable has to be continuous
  - Don't include interaction terms for this analysis
